# Keyboard Control for Guo Juan's Internet Go School

[Guo Juan's Internet Go School](https://internetgoschool.com/) is a neat web app, but it hardly
supports any keyboard controls by default. This Firefox extension adds various keyboard controls,
making it faster and more convenient to navigate through problems and lessons.
